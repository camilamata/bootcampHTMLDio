    <h2 id="hystory">History</h2>
    <small><a href="#sumary">Sumary</a></small>
    <p>When the Wars of Conquest began and Aegon the Conqueror swept through Westeros, Loren I, King of the Rock, sided
        with Mern IX Gardener, King of the Reach, against the Targaryens. The host of the Two Kings numbered fifty-five
        thousand men, five thousand of them mounted knights, while the Targaryens had only ten thousand men, many of
        uncertain loyalty and reliability. The two armies met in the plains of the Reach south of the Blackwater Rush.
        With their smaller force severely weakened and in danger of routing, Aegon and his sisters, Visenya and Rhaenys,
        each deployed their three dragons, the only time this happened during Aegon's Conquest. Their combined fires
        scoured the battlefield, immolating more than four thousand men (including King Mern and his heirs) in the Field
        of Fire.[16]

        After he was captured the following day, King Loren the Last bent the knee to Aegon and was allowed to remain
        Lord of Casterly Rock. Loren rose as the first Warden of the West.[17] Queen Visenya is said to have been
        grateful that Loren rode to war instead of seeking refuge in his castle, as Casterly Rock may have withst.</p>

    <p>The royal marriage and the increasing amount of gold King Robert I Baratheon owes to Lord Tywin Lannister have only increased Lannister power.[54] Much of Tywin's energy is directed inward, ensuring all of his relatives do their part to uphold the family name.[55]

        On behalf of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, Euron and Victarion Greyjoy began Greyjoy's Rebellion with the burning of the Lannister fleet.[56] Tywin joined Robert and Eddard Stark, Warden of the West, in invading the Iron Islands, however, and the rebellion was defeated.[57]
        
        Tywin attended the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day in King's Landing. Queen Cersei Lannister and her children accompanied Tywin during his return to Casterly Rock; en route they were informed of the death of Jon Arryn, Robert's Hand of the King.[58]

        Os Lannisters também comandar uma modesta frota Lannister, atracada em Lanisporto. A frota foi em grande parte
        destruída fundeada durante a rebelião Greyjoy em um ataque preventivo conduzido pelos irmãos de Balon Greyjoy
